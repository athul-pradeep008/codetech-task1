Project Title: Basic Calculator Program in Java

Objective: To design and implement a basic calculator program in Java that takes two numbers and an operation as input from the user and displays the result of the operation.

Key Activities:

Requirements Gathering: Identify the requirements of the project, including the need to prompt the user for two numbers and an operation, perform the selected operation, and display the result.
Design: Design the program structure, including the use of a Scanner object to read input from the user, and a switch statement to perform the selected operation.
Implementation: Implement the program in Java, including writing the code to prompt the user for input, perform the selected operation, and display the result.
Testing: Test the program to ensure that it works correctly for different inputs and operations.
Key Deliverables:

A working Java program that acts as a basic calculator
A clear and concise explanation of how the program works
A list of key activities and deliverables for the project
Skills Demonstrated:

Java programming skills
Problem-solving skills
Analytical skills
Communication skills
Challenges Overcome:

Handling division by zero error
Ensuring that the program works correctly for different inputs and operations

Project Title: Grade Tracker Program in Java

Objective: To design and implement a Java program to track and manage student grades, allowing the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade or GPA.

Key Activities:

Requirements Gathering: Identify the requirements of the project, including the need to input grades, calculate the average grade, and display additional information.
Design: Design the program structure, including the use of a Map to store grades and helper methods to calculate letter grade and GPA.
Implementation: Implement the program in Java, including writing the code to input grades, calculate the average grade, and display additional information.
Testing: Test the program to ensure that it works correctly for different inputs and grades.
Key Deliverables:

A working Java program to track and manage student grades
A clear and concise explanation of how the program works
A list of key activities and deliverables for the project
Skills Demonstrated:

Java programming skills
Problem-solving skills
Analytical skills
Communication skills
Challenges Overcome:

Handling different types of grades (e.g. letter grades, GPA)
Ensuring that the program works correctly for different inputs and grades
Program Explanation:

The program allows the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, which are stored in a Map called grades. The program then calculates the average grade by summing up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades. The program displays the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA using helper methods getLetterGrade and getGPA. Finally, the program displays individual grades for each subject or assignment.
